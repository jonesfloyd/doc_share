<h1> Upgrading the Drupal version of a Private Cloud installation </h1>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Edge for Private Cloud v. 4.</em><em>18.01</em></p>
<div class="note">
	<p>This upgrade is for your Private Cloud installation of Drupal only. For customers using a cloud deployment of the portal, Apigee will automatically apply all Drupal security updates.</p>
</div>
<p>In an Edge for Private Cloud installation of the Developer Services portal, you might get a notification that a new version of Drupal is available. A new version can mean a Drupal feature release, patch, security update, or other type of Drupal update. In the case of a security update, you want to upgrade your installation of Drupal as soon as possible to ensure that your site remains secure.</p>
<p>The procedure below describes how to update a Private Cloud installation of Drupal 7.x.y to another minor version (for example Drupal 7.54 to 7.56).</p>
<p>Please note the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>This procedure only updates your installation of Drupal. It does not update the Apigee software that ships as part of the portal. For information on upgrading the Apigee portal software, see <a href="https://docs.apigee.com/private-cloud/latest/upgrading-developer-services-portal">Upgrading the Developer Services portal</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>You have to run Drush commands from the root directory of the portal site. By default, the Developer Portal is installed at:
		<ul>
			<li><code>/opt/apigee/apigee-drupal/wwwroot</code> (Nginx)</li>
			<li><code>/var/www/html</code> (Apache)</li>
		</ul>
		The procedure below assumes an Nginx server installation at the default location above.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Determining your current Drupal version</h2>
<p>Before you start the Drupal update, you can determine your current Drupal version by running the following command from the Drupal installation folder. By default, Drupal is installed in <code>/opt/apigee/apigee-drupal/wwwroot</code>:</p>
<pre>
&gt; cd /opt/apigee/apigee-drupal/wwwroot
&gt; drush status | grep 'Drupal version'</pre>
<p>You should see output in the form:</p>
<pre>
Drupal version                  :  7.54  </pre>
<p>If you installed Drupal in a directory other than <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">/opt/apigee/apigee-drupal/wwwroot</span>, make sure to change to that directory before running the <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">drush</span> command.</p>
<h2>Updating the Drupal version</h2>
<p>This section describes how to use <a href="http://www.drush.org" target="_blank">Drush</a> (Drupal Shell) from a command line to update your Drupal version. See also, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2550801" target="_blank">Updating Drupal Using Drush</a> in the Drupal documentation.</p>
<div class="note">
	<p>If your portal is on a server with no external internet connection, then download the drupal installation to a server with internet access, copy the drupal-x.y directory to your portal server, and follow the steps described in the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/upgrade-to-drupal-7/read-upgradetxt" target="_blank">README.txt</a> file in the Drupal documentation.</p>
</div>
<p>To update your Drupal installation:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Change to the <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">/opt/apigee/apigee-drupal/wwwroot</span> directory, or the directory where you installed the portal.</li>
	<li>Make a full backup of all files, directories, and databases. Save the backup in a location outside of the Drupal installation. For complete instructions, see <a href="https://docs.apigee.com/private-cloud/latest/backup-portal">Back up the portal</a>.
		<p>If you made modifications to files such as <code>.htaccess</code>, <code>robots.txt</code>, or <code>defaults.settings.php</code> (in the <code>sites</code> directory), you will have to reapply the changes after the update. You will also need to reapply any customizations made in the <code>sites/all</code> directory.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Put your site into maintenance mode:&nbsp;<br />
		<pre>
&gt; drush vset --exact maintenance_mode 1 
&gt; drush cache-clear all</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Install the desired version of Drupal by using the following command:<br />
		<br />
		<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&gt; drush pm-update drupal-7.56</span><br />
		<br />
		<strong>Note:</strong> Replace 7.56 with the desired version.<br />
		Alternatively, you can run <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">drush pm-update drupal</span> to update to the latest Drupal core version. You can run <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">drush pm-updatestatus</span> to list available minor updates to Drupal core and contrib projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Reapply any changes made to&nbsp;<code>.htaccess</code>,&nbsp;<code>robots.txt</code>, or&nbsp;<code>defaults.settings.php</code>&nbsp;(in the&nbsp;<code>sites</code>&nbsp;directory).</li>
	<li>Reapply any changes made to the&nbsp;<code>sites/all&nbsp;</code>directory.</li>
	<li>Take your site out of maintenance mode:&nbsp;<br />
		<pre>
&gt; drush vset --exact maintenance_mode 0 
&gt; drush cache-clear all</pre>
	</li>
</ol>
<h2>What if I encounter an issue during the update?</h2>
<p>Restore your site to its previous state using the backup files that you created. Contact your Apigee support representative and provide any error messages that were reported during the update.</p>
