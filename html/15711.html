<h2>What does this dashboard tell me?</h2>
<p>The Developer Engagement dashboard tells you which of your registered app developers are generating the most API traffic. For each of your developers, you can find out who is generating the most API traffic and the most errors. For example, if a particular developer's app is generating a lot of errors relative to other developers, you can pro-actively address the problem with that developer.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What else do I need to know about this dashboard?</h2>
<p>You can view metrics for all proxies or drill into specific proxies using the<strong> Metric </strong>dropdown menu at the top of the dashboard.</p>
<p>This dashboard uses standard controls, like the date and data aggregation selectors, hovering over graphs for more context, and so on. To learn more, see <a href="http://docs.apigee.com/node/15971">http://docs.apigee.com/node/15971</a>.</p>
