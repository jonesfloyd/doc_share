<h1> What does an analytics entity value "(not set)" mean? </h1>
<p>As you review your analytics, you may see an entity value of&nbsp;<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">(not set)</span>&nbsp;displayed, including the parenthesis, for your <strong>API Proxies</strong>, <strong>Product</strong>, <strong>Developer</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Developer Apps</strong>&nbsp;and other dimensions. This may or may not be an issue.</p>
<p>Oftentimes,&nbsp;<code>(not set)</code> means Edge doesn't have enough information. For example, developer apps are associated with developers, API products, and by extension API proxies. When a developer app makes an API call with an API key or OAuth token, all those associations are made in analytics. However, if an API proxy is open and doesn't require an API key, Edge has no way of knowing if there is a developer, developer app, or product associated with the API call.</p>
<p>Other times, <code>(not set)</code>&nbsp;could mean "doesn't apply." For example, the "Flow Name on Error" dimension shows the named API proxy flows where errors occurred. In that case, all non-error calls will be shown as <code>(not set)</code>&nbsp;because there was no error in the calls.</p>
<p>See below for possible explanations of why you are seeing a&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">(not set)</span>&nbsp;entity on some dimensions.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>You see a&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">(not set)</span>&nbsp;entity for the <strong>API Proxies</strong> dimension.</p>
		<p>This means that a call to an API proxy reached the Apigee routers, but was malformed, never reached the proxy, and the message processor returned a 404 status code with a classification error. This means that there are some callers that are making malformed calls.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>You see an&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">(not set)</span>&nbsp;entity for the <strong>Product</strong> dimension entity.</p>
		<p>This means that not all of your API proxies and developer apps are using products.</p>
		<p>For information about how to get your API proxies and developer apps to use products, see <a href="http://docs.apigee.com/node/9">http://docs.apigee.com/node/9</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>You see an&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">(not set)</span> entity for the <strong>Developer</strong> dimension.</p>
		<p>This means that some of your traffic is being generated by unregistered developers. This traffic may originate with an internal-use or public API.</p>

	<li>
		<p>You see a&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">(not set)</span>&nbsp;entity for the <strong>Developer Apps</strong> dimension.</p>
		<p>This means that some of your traffic is being generated by unregistered apps. This traffic may originate with an internal-use or public API.</p>
		<p>For information about how to register your developers' apps, see <a href="http://docs.apigee.com/node/158">http://docs.apigee.com/node/158</a>.</p>
