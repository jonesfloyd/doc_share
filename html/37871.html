<h1> Forbidden Errors </h1>
<h2>Error text</h2>
<pre class="prettyprint">
Forbidden. [Description] </pre>
<p>where <code>[Description]</code> is a string that describes the cause of the error.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<pre class="prettyprint">
Forbidden. You don't have permissions to access this resource. </pre>
<p>You typically see <strong>Forbidden</strong> error messages when making API calls. One common cause is when an organization administrator, or other type of user, makes a call to an Edge management API that requires system administrator credentials.</p>
<p>For example, to use the Edge management API to create a user on Edge in the Cloud, you make a POST request to <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/users</span>. However, if you pass credentials for any user other than the sys admin, the call returns HTTP 403 Forbidden error, as shown below:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&gt; POST /v1/users HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: api.enterprise.apigee.com
&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.54.0
&gt; Accept: */*
&gt; Content-Type:application/xml
&gt; Content-Length: 162
&gt;
* upload completely sent off: 162 out of 162 bytes
&lt; HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
</pre>
<div class="note">
	<p><strong>Forbidden</strong> errors in the Edge UI, those typically caused by the return of an HTTP 403 response code, typically appear as <strong>Insufficient permissions</strong> errors. The troubleshooting steps for the two errors are similar. See <a href="http://docs.apigee.com/node/37861">http://docs.apigee.com/node/37861</a> for more.</p>
</div>
<h2>What this error means</h2>
<p>Every user in an Edge organization is assigned to a role, where roles are essentially CRUD-based permission sets. CRUD means "create, read, update, delete". For example, a user may be given a role that permits them to read, or "get", details about an entity, but not permission to "update" or "delete" it.</p>
<p>The <strong>Forbidden</strong> error typically means that the role assigned to the user does not have permissions to perform the requested operation.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>General troubleshooting steps</h3>
<p>Although you may need expert help from Apigee to resolve this error, you can try the following general troubleshooting steps before contacting support or posting to the Apigee Community.</p>
<h4>Are you a new customer who just created your first organization?</h4>
<p>For new users to Apigee who are creating their first organization, it can take Apigee several hours to complete the creation process. If you see <strong>Forbidden</strong> errors in a new organization, wait a few hours and try again.</p>
<h4>Check to see if another user recently changed permissions</h4>
<p>In the Edge UI, select <strong>Admin &gt; Organization History</strong> to see if there were any recent changes to permissions. Look for permissions that were recently created or removed:</p>

<h4>Are you making an API call that requires sys admin credentials?</h4>
<p>Several Edge management APIs require you to pass sys admin credentials, such as the following APIs:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://docs.apigee.com/node/21111">http://docs.apigee.com/node/21111</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://docs.apigee.com/node/21126">http://docs.apigee.com/node/21126</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a Cloud customer, Apigee acts as the sys admin. Therefore, if you need to perform an action that requires sys admin permissions, you must contact <a href="http://support.apigee.com/">Apigee Support</a>.</p>
<p>If you run into the <strong>Forbidden</strong> error when making an Edge management API call, check the <a href="http://docs.apigee.com/node/8403">http://docs.apigee.com/node/8403</a> to determine the requirements for calling the API.</p>
<h4>Are you creating or editing a role to give it access to a protected resource?</h4>
<p>Edge lets you create custom roles to control user access to protected resources. For example, you can create roles to control access to APIs, products, and reports. See <a href="http://docs.apigee.com/node/18361">http://docs.apigee.com/node/18361</a> for more.</p>
<p>However, only a sys admin can create roles that specify permissions for the following resources:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>/environments</code></li>
	<li><code>/environments/*</code></li>
	<li><code>/environments/*/keystores/*/aliases/*/key</code></li>
	<li><code>/environments/*/pods</code></li>
	<li><code>/environments/*/servers</code></li>
	<li><code>/pods</code></li>
	<li><code>/rebuildindex</code></li>
	<li><code>/userroles/devadmin</code></li>
	<li><code>/userroles/devadmin/permissions</code></li>
	<li><code>/userroles/devadmin/permissions/*</code></li>
	<li><code>/userroles/devadmin/users</code></li>
	<li><code>/userroles/devadmin/users/*</code></li>
	<li><code>/users/*/status</code></li>
	<li><code>/users</code></li>
	<li><code>/users/*</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If you attempt to create a role that assigns permissions to these resources, you will get a <strong>Forbidden</strong> error.</p>
<h4>For Cloud customers, check the Apigee status page for outages</h4>
<p><strong>Forbidden</strong> errors can occur when there is an outage in Edge for the Cloud. Use the following URL to check the current Edge status to see if there is an outage:</p>

<h3>Are you using a version of Edge Cloud that includes customer support?</h3>
<p>Although you may need to contact Apigee support to resolve this error, you might first try the steps described above in&nbsp;<a href="#troubleshooting-generaltroubleshootingsteps">General troubleshooting steps</a>. If you need Apigee help, please see <a href="http://docs.apigee.com/node/37866">http://docs.apigee.com/node/37866</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Are you using Edge Private cloud?</h3>
<p>In a Private Cloud installation, you define a sys admin. If you need to perform an operation that requires the sys admin credentials, such as creating an organization, then you must work with the Edge sys admin.</p>
<h3>Are you using a free evaluation version of Apigee Edge?</h3>
<p>Although you may need to post your issue to the&nbsp;<a href="https://community.apigee.com/index.html">Apigee Community</a>&nbsp;to resolve this error, you might first try the steps described above in&nbsp;<a href="#troubleshooting-generaltroubleshootingsteps">General troubleshooting steps</a>.&nbsp;</p>
