<h1> Sending an access token </h1>
[toc]
<p>As an app developer, you need to include an access token in any request to Apigee Edge for a protected resource (an API that is protected with a VerifyAccessToken policy). Note that access tokens are also called "bearer tokens."&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Sending an access token in a request</h2>
<p>When you put a VerifyAccessToken policy at the front of your API proxy flow, apps must present a verifiable&nbsp;<strong>access token</strong>&nbsp;(also called a "bearer token") to consume your API. To do this, the app sends the access token in the request as an&nbsp;<strong>"Authorization" HTTP header</strong>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ylSkZIjbdWybfs4fUQe9BqP0LH5Z" http://{org_name}-test.apigee.net/weather/forecastrss?w=12797282</pre>
<p>Apigee Edge will verify that the access token presented is valid, and then grant access to the API, returning the response to the app that made the request.</p>
