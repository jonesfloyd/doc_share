<h1> Read-only system administrator role </h1>
<div class="opdk">
	<p><b>Edge on-premises installation only.&nbsp;</b>In a Cloud-based installation of Edge, Apigee functions in the role of read-only system administrator. You can only assign global users to the read-only system administrator role in an Edge for the Private Cloud installation.</p>
</div>
<p>An&nbsp;<strong>Edge read-only system administrator</strong>&nbsp;has access to the same entities as an system administrator but access is read-only. A read-only system administrator can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Perform the operations of the <a href="http://docs.apigee.com/node/18346">http://docs.apigee.com/node/18346</a> for all organizations</li>
	<li>View global user details</li>
	<li>View organization, environment, and virtual host configurations</li>
	<li>Make read-only calls to all Edge system administrative APIs</li>
</ul>
<div class="note">
	<p>While it is not required, you can assign a read-only system administrator to an organization, typically as a read-only organization administrator. Unless assigned to an organization, the read-only&nbsp;system administrator cannot log in to the Edge management UI.</p>
</div>
<p>For more on the actions allowed by the read-only&nbsp;system administrator, see the&nbsp;Edge <em>Operations Guide</em>, available on the Apigee ftp site: <a href="ftp://ftp.apigee.com/">ftp://ftp.apigee.com/</a>.</p>
