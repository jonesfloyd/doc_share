<h1> Audits: API, Product, and organization history </h1>
<p>[toc]</p>
<p>Apigee Edge provides a "history" feature that can be helpful in troubleshooting problems as well as managing API usage. The history feature enables you to view the operations (create, update, read, delete, deploy, undeploy) that have been performed on your APIs and API products over time. You can see who performed each operation, when the operation was performed, the request URI, and the response code. For update operations, you can also view the request body that was as passed in the API call.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Select the API from the summary list on the API proxies page.</li>
	<li>On the API detail page, click Project, and choose API Proxy History.
