<h1> Content-based security </h1>
[toc]
<p>Message content is a significant attack vector used by malicious API consumers. API Services provides a set of Policy types to mitigate the potential for your backend services to be compromised by attackers or by malformed request payloads.</p>
<p>The following video provides an overview and focuses on protecting against SQL injection attacks.</p>

<h2>JSON threat protection</h2>
<p>JSON attacks attempt to use structures that overwhelm JSON parsers to crash a service and induce application-level denial-of-service attacks.</p>
<p>Such attacks can be mitigated using the JSONThreatProtection Policy type.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://docs.apigee.com/node/365">http://docs.apigee.com/node/365</a>.</p>
<h2>XML threat protection</h2>
<p>XML attacks attempt to use structures that overwhelm XML parsers to crash a service and induce application-level denial-of-service attacks.</p>
<p>Such attacks can be mitigated using the XMLThreatProtection Policy type.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://docs.apigee.com/node/30">http://docs.apigee.com/node/30</a>.</p>
<h2>General content protection</h2>
<p>Some content-based attacks use specific constructs in HTTP headers, query parameters, or payload content to attempt to execute code. An example is SQL-injection attacks. Such attacks can be mitigated using the RegularExpressionProtection Policy type.</p>
