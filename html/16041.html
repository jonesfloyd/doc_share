<h2>What else do I need to know about this dashboard?</h2>
<p>You can view metrics for all proxies or drill into specific proxies using the<strong> Proxy Dimension </strong>dropdown menu at the top of the dashboard.</p>
<p>This dashboard uses standard controls, like the date and data aggregation selectors, hovering over graphs for more context, exporting data to CSV, and so on. To learn more, see <a href="http://docs.apigee.com/node/15971">http://docs.apigee.com/node/15971</a>.</p>
