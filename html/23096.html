<h1> Apigee deprecation policy </h1>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Discontinuance of Services</strong>. Subject to Section 2 (next), Apigee may discontinue any Product, Service, or any portion or feature for any reason at any time without liability to Customer.</li>
	<li><strong>Deprecation Policy</strong>. Apigee will announce if it intends to discontinue or make backwards incompatible changes to the Product, Services, or features specified at <a href="http://docs.apigee.com/node/23796">http://docs.apigee.com/node/23796</a>. Apigee will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to operate and support those Products or Services versions and features without these changes for at least one year after that announcement, unless (as Apigee determines in its reasonable good faith judgment):<br />
		(i) required by law or third party relationship (including if there is a change in applicable law or relationship), or<br />
		(ii) doing so could create a security risk or substantial economic or material technical burden.<br />
		<br />
		After that point, the Product, Service, or feature will be designated as Retired. For more information about Apigee product release stages, <a href="/release-stages">https://docs.apigee.com/release-stages</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The above policy is the "Deprecation Policy."</p>
<p>See <a href="http://docs.apigee.com/node/23796">http://docs.apigee.com/node/23796</a> for a list of deprecated and retired features.</p>
<div class="note">
	<p><strong>Deprecations in Private Cloud releases</strong></p>
	<p>Deprecation timelines usually follow Apigee cloud release timelines. For example, if a deprecation announcement for feature "X" occurs on March 1, 2017, the feature is scheduled to be retired in a cloud release around March 1, 2018.<br />
		&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Because Private Cloud releases include cloud features that were released or updated earlier, deprecation and retirement dates of those features in Private Cloud versions are slightly offset. For example, a Private Cloud release in May 2018 includes a cloud release in which feature "X" was retired (around March 1, 2018). Therefore, feature "X" is retired in May 2018 for Private Cloud.<br />
		&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Any deprecations and retirements that are specific to Private Cloud will be noted in the Private Cloud release notes and will follow a one-year timeline according to Private Cloud release cycles.</p>
