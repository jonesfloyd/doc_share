<h1> Edge network design and firewalls </h1>
<p>Apigee Edge is built in the cloud using a multi-tiered network design. The network is designed to expose only the required services and instances to the Internet and keep all other services internal to the virtual private cloud. It is an evolution of the three-tier DMZ design used in traditional datacenters. By default, new instances do not have access to the Internet, ingress or egress. Specific actions must be taken to even allow an instance to communicate with or over the Internet.</p>
<p>All instances are also protected by the cloud equivalent of firewalls. These are commonly called "security groups." Apigee uses instance-based security groups that treat each instance like an island with very specific ingress and egress access required to be explicitly allowed. Apigee uses a continuous monitoring and enforcement tool on our security group configurations along with an event monitoring system for security group changes. One tool is responsible to continuously evaluate all security groups for deviation from the defined standard. Any unauthorized change is automatically reverted. Another tool is used to monitor and record all actions taken by administrators in Edge. This record is also evaluated for any changes to security groups and alerts sent whenever a change is detected.</p>
<p>All authorized changes done through the proper process are tracked, logged, and reported for correlation with change control approvals.</p>
