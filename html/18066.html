<h1> Using TLS with Edge </h1>
<p>[toc]</p>
<p>Apigee Edge has several entry points that you might want to secure with TLS. In addition, Edge add-ons, such as the Developer Services portal, have entry points that can be configured to use TLS.</p>
<p>The Edge TLS configuration procedure depends on how you deployed Edge: <strong>Apigee Edge&nbsp;cloud</strong> or <strong>Apigee Edge for Private Cloud</strong>.</p>
<h3>Cloud-based deployment</h3>
<p>A cloud-based deployment of Edge means that most of the TLS configuration is handled by Apigee. You are only responsible for providing Apigee with a valid TLS certificate and private key. Apigee then handles the configuration required for TLS access.</p>
<p>The one area where Apigee cannot completely configure TLS is when you use two-way TLS between Edge and your backend service. In this situation, either you or Apigee have to handle the TLS configuration on Edge, and you must make sure to configure TLS correctly on your backend servers.</p>
<p>For the cloud version of the Developer Services portal, you configure TLS on on the Pantheon hosting server.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="http://docs.apigee.com/node/18071">http://docs.apigee.com/node/18071</a>.</p>
<h3>Private Cloud deployment</h3>
<p>For an Apigee Edge for Private Cloud installation of the Developer Services portal, you are completely responsible for configuring TLS. That means you not only have to obtain the TLS certificate and private key, but you also have to configure Edge to use TLS.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="http://docs.apigee.com/node/18076">http://docs.apigee.com/node/18076</a>.</p>
<h2>Where Edge uses TLS</h2>
<p>The following images shows the places in an Edge installation where you can configure TLS:</p>

<div class="note">
	<p>Most of the connections between the Edge components have been omitted to simplify this image.</p>
</div>
<p>Apigee Edge for Private Cloud customers typically configure all connections to use TLS. However, for cloud customers, Apigee handles most of the TLS configuration for you and only have to configure TLS for connections 3 and 4 shown in the figure. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The following table describes these TLS connections:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="table">

<p>The following image shows a scenario where the API client accesses Edge through a load balancer, rather than accessing the Router directly:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="sites/docs/files/EdgeSSLELB.png" style="width: 182px; height: 300px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 15px;" /></p>
<p>The cloud-based version of Edge is typically configured to use a load balancer. For Private Cloud installations, the presence of a load balancer is dependent on your network configuration of Edge.</p>
<div class="note">
	<p>Load balancers often cannot be configured to support two-way TLS.</p>
</div>
<p>When using a load balancer, you can configure TLS between the API client and the load balancer and, if necessary, between the load balancer and the Router, as the following table describes:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="table">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>&nbsp;</th>
			<th>
				<p><strong>Source</strong></p>

				<p>6</p>

			<td>
				<p>API Client (app)</p>
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>Load Balancer</p>
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>Apps access your APIs by making requests to API proxies through a load balancer. The load balancer forwards the request to an Edge Router.</p>
				<p>You can configure TLS on the entry point of the load balancer. The way you configure TLS is based on the load balancer.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<p>7</p>
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>Load Balancer</p>
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>Router</p>
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>Depending on your configuration, you might configure TLS access to the Router from the load balancer. In that case, you configure TLS just as if the load balancer was not present.</p>
				<p>Or, if the load balancer and Router are in the same security domain, TLS configuration may not be necessary. However, that is dependent on your network configuration.</p>

<h2>Where the Developer Services portal uses TLS</h2>

<p>Apigee Edge for Private Cloud and Edge cloud customers configure TLS on both connections. The following table describes these connections in more detail:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="table">
	<thead>
