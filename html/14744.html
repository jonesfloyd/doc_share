<h1> Using performance metrics </h1>
<p>[toc]</p>
<p>The Apigee Edge Analytics Services API lets you monitor and manage API performance and health. The Analytics Services API is a valuable tool that you can use to troubleshoot problems. For example, if your API goes down, analytics charts can help illustrate whether the failure was sudden or involved a slow lead-in time. If your API is slowing down, simulated transactions can help you determine how and where the bottlenecks are. In addition, analytics can help you diagnose usage problems, such as a sudden spike in traffic or the opposite, a sudden decrease in traffic.&nbsp;</p>
