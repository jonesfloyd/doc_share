<h1> Proxy Performance </h1>
<p>[toc]</p>
<h2>What does this dashboard tell me?</h2>
<p>The Proxy Performance dashboard helps you see API proxy traffic patterns and processing times. You can easily visualize how much traffic your APIs generate and how long it takes for API calls to be processed, from the time they are received by Apigee Edge until they are returned to the client app.</p>

				<p>The average of the Total Response Time measured for all API calls made to an Apigee Edge organization environment. The Total Response Time is the amount of time it takes for an API call to Edge to return (in milliseconds).</p>
				<p>Or, put another way, total response time is the time measured from when an entire API call is received on Apigee Edge to the time Edge begins sending a response back to the client app.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>This chart measures the average for all proxies. For individual proxies, see the Average Response Time by Proxy chart below.&nbsp;</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>Average Proxy Response Time</strong></td>
			<td>
				<p>This value is calculated as the average of the Total Response Time minus the Target Response Time for all API calls made to an Apigee Edge organization environment.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>It's basically a measure of how much time the API calls spend flowing through Apigee Edge itself (in milliseconds).&nbsp;</p>
			</td>
		</tr>

			<td><strong>Average Target Response Time</strong></td>
			<td>
				<p>The average number of milliseconds that it takes from the point the last byte of a request is sent from Apigee Edge to a backend target to the time Edge receives the last byte of the response.</p>
				<p>It's basically measuring how much time the API call spends on the target system.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What else do I need to know about this dashboard?</h2>
<p>You can view metrics for all proxies or drill into specific proxies using the <strong>Proxy</strong> dimension dropdown menu at the top of the dashboard.</p>
<p>Click this icon to sort the selected metric:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="sites/docs/files/ax-sort-button.png" style="width: 275px; height: 64px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /></p>
<ul>
	<li>A light gray icon means means you can sort it; if you mouse over a light gray icon, it turns blue.</li>
	<li>A dark gray means it is currently sorted.</li>
</ul>
<p>This dashboard uses standard controls, like the date and data aggregation selectors, hovering over graphs for more context, click and drag to zoom, and so on. To learn more, see <a href="http://docs.apigee.com/node/15971">http://docs.apigee.com/node/15971</a>.</p>
